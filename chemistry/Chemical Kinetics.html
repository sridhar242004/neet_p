            <p>Chemical kinetics is the branch of chemistry concerned with the study of reaction rates and the factors that influence them. It explores how quickly or slowly reactions occur, the mechanisms by which they proceed, and the conditions under which they are most favorable. Understanding chemical kinetics is crucial for designing and optimizing processes in fields ranging from industrial chemistry to environmental science.</p>
